# 30590 Notes & Code

My personal notes and practice code for Universit√† Bocconi's Advanced Python Programming for Economics, Management and Finance class (code 30590).

## How to use
The notes and code can be read directly on GitHub, or you can download them to your own computer. 

### Making/Locating Your Local Class Directory
To do this, you'll need to know the path to the directory you'd like to download it into. I recommend making a directory for this class specifically; below are ways you can do this:
- Create a folder on your desktop (your path will be ~/Desktop/name_of_repo; do this using your OS's GUI)
- Create a directory somewhere else (do this by going into the terminal and typing [mkdir name_of_repo])
Before you proceed, ensure you know the path to your directory.

### Pull files
You have the option to pull the entire repository (every file in this GitHub page) or to pull only specific files from the cloud to your local computer. This section will soon contain instructions for both. For now, [here's a good reference on how to pull files](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull)
